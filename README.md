# digital-signal-processing
Simple JavaFX program allowing to generate, display and process digital signals

Example usage:
1. Choose type of signal generator from the list view on the left
2. Adjust parameters of the signal
3. Press "Generate signal" button
4. Generated signal will appear in the list view on the right and it will be automatically selected
5. Press "Show graph" to display the signal amplitude in the time domain
6. Adjust number of bins and press "Show histogram" to display the histogram of the amplitude  
Other options:  
* signal addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
* convolution and correlation
* sampling
* interpolation and sinc reconstruction
* calculating average, average magnitude, power, variance and effective value of a signal
* calculating mean squared error, signal to noise ration, peak signal to noise ratio and maximal difference of two signals
* filtering signal with low-pass, band-pass and high-pass filter
* saving / loading generated signals from file
